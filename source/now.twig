        Rector has <a href="https://getrector.org/">new website</a> and stickers - what a month! I <a href="/talks/#rector">talked about Rector in Havlíčkův Brod, Brno, Vienna and Dresden</a>. The amazing audiences and feedback like "man, I needed this years ago", "how? what?... amazing" gives me drive to continue this journey to instantly upgrade all code over the world.
